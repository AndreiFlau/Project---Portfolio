      <p>
        Hello! 👋🏻 I&apos;m Andrei Flausino, a Full-Stack Web Developer from Brazil who enjoys creating fun and interactive
        webapps. <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;ve always been passionate about computers since I was young. Constantly fiddling around with computer files,
        modding video games, and installing all sorts of stuff on my parent&apos;s computer. <br />
        {/* After a lot of thinking, I finally decided that the obvious carrer path for me had to be Software Engineering. <br />I
        attended college at <a href="https://www.anhanguera.com/">Anhanguera</a>, getting a degree in Information Technology. */}
        Eventually I got a degree in Information Technology and have been improving my programming skills ever since.
